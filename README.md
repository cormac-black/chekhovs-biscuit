#SuperHero PiBooth 

This project at a high-level has students take a photo of themselves using a Rasberry Pi 5, and prints/emails them their photo after it has been cartoonized.

ShPiBver1.py is the current working version. 

filterFest.py is a smaller version of the code, which has students select a color mapping of their photo and only prints it out, if they would like.
